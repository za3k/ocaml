I'm going to do a little ocaml programming. I should think of a fun tiny project to get comfortable in the language. Later goals are stuff like syscalls, network programming, etc.

How about something like Tetris or a simple roguelike, that kind of thing, for today?
Something turn based would be easiest, I'll do that.
Hmm. Chess? Chessrogue clone?


Sounds too complciated.
Some kind of choose your own adventure novel? More fun, let's do that.

.ml: implementation file (.c equiv)
.mli: interface file (.h ish equiv)

What is a good editor for ocaml? VSCode.
